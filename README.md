This repository contains the code for a fully functional MERN application with CRUD capabilities. The app has not been deployed and
the node module files are not included in the repository. The app includes a log page connected to a MongoDB database that stores 
job application information with CRUD functionality. There is also a staff page which connects to a random user generation API for added 
functionality. The purpose of this project was to showcase my capabilities as a full stack developer using the MERN stack.
